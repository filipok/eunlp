TMX maker version 3.0
by András Farkas

This should be pretty self-explanatory: the TMX maker is basically the TMX generator ripped out of the aligner and made into a separate program. As such, it uses the same setup file (LF_aligner_setup.txt).
If you didn't generate a TMX after an alignment with LF Aligner but later on you decide you need one after all, use aligned_XXX.txt as your input file. Of course, you can also use any other tab-delimited UTF-8 txt file, not just ones generated by LF Aligner.
As of version 2.23, the TMX maker supports xls input files on top of UTF-8 txt. Despite that, txt is still the recommended input format as it's more reliable. To get a txt from an xls, you can copy-paste the relevant parts of your spreadsheet to a text editor and use File/Save as to save it in UTF-8 encoding. If you do use an xls for input, all worksheets will be converted to txt and used as input.


Batch alignment using command line arguments:

As of version 3.0, the TMX maker can be launched with command line arguments, just like the aligner. This allows you to generate many TMX files at once, and it also makes it possible to integrate the tmx maker with your own software (write software that calls the tmx maker in an automated fashion without human interaction). Note that you do not need to use command line arguments to generate one TMX file out of many input files (see end of readme).

The easiest way to use command line arguments in Windows is to open a text editor and type in the commands, one command per line. Save the file as a .bat in the same folder as the aligner, then just double click it to launch. On linux and mac, you need to write a simple bash script that does the same. When launching the aligner with command line arguments, the GUI is switched off.
The arguments (settings) have to be provided with the following syntax: --[argname]="[argvalue]" or --[argname]="[value1]","[value2]". Note that there is no space after the comma. You can enter the arguments in any order, and you can leave out arguments.

There are three arguments:

Infiles - the (one or more) input files. You have to provide the full file paths, separated by commas.
Codes - TMX language codes, separated by commas.
Outfile - The full path and name of the output file. If omitted, the default is set automatically.


Here's a sample command:

C:\aligner_perl\TMX_maker_3.0.exe -i "C:\aligner\new\aligned_32006L0112_en-hu-es.txt","C:\aligner\new\aligned_COM_2012_0550_en-hu-es.txt" -c
 en-gb,hu-hu,es-es


Note that file names that contain a space must be in double quotes. Therefore, it's good policy to write all file names in double quotes (unless you drag and drop them into the console). As values are comma separated, file names that contain a comma are not supported.
There isn't a lot of error checking done on command line input, so make sure you follow the syntax, don't make typos etc. If you get an "Unknown option: xxx" error message when the script starts, you've messed up.
As a general rule, perl - and thus LF Aligner - does not support non-ASCII file names on Windows. However, it appears that command line argument mode is not subject to this limitation. I.e. if you use command line arguments to specify the file names, you can process files like c:\úőóüí\file.txt or c:\folder\ííí.html, which would otherwise be rejected.



There are two noteworthy features that are not self-evident:
- The TMX maker can generate multilingual TMX files, e.g. with English, Spanish, Italian and French all in the same TMX. When you import a multilingual TMX, your CAT tool will decide which languages to import based on the setup of your TM.
- The TMX maker can also handle multiple input files in Windows. You can just select any number of input files in the browsing window while keeping Ctrl pressed, and they will all be imported into the same TMX. You can even mix xls and txt input files and make a TMX out of them in one go. If there is more than one input file, the default name of the output file will be same as the last input file.
