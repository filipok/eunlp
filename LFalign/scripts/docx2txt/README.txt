docx2txt (http://docx2txt.sourceforge.net/) is a simple tool to generate
equivalent text files from Microsoft .docx documents, with an attempt towards
preserving sufficient formatting and document information, and appropriate
character conversions for a good text experience.

You need to atleast have perl installed on your system for using this tool.


How to Use
----------

You can do the text conversion in different ways depending upon your usage
environment.

1. Using docx2txt.sh :

   docx2txt.sh file.docx
          OR
   docx2txt.sh file

   In both these cases output text will be saved in file.txt .

2. Using docx2txt.pl :

   a. docx2txt.pl infile.docx outfile.txt

      Use - as the name of output text file, to send extracted text to the
      stdout/terminal.

   b. docx2txt.pl file.docx
             OR
      docx2txt.pl file

      In both these cases output text will be saved in file.txt .

3. Using docx2txt.bat :

   docx2txt.bat file.docx
          OR
   docx2txt.bat file

   In both these cases output text will be saved in file.txt .

Input argument in all the above cases can also be a directory holding the
unzipped content of a .docx file. This feature is particulary useful if you do
not have a commandline unzipping tool like Unzip/CakeCmd installed on your
system.


Tune your Experience
--------------------

You can change these settings via docx2txt.config file located either in current
directory or in same location as the docx2txt.pl script.
 
- path to unzip program
- newline in output text file (Unix/Dos way)
- list level indentation amount
- line width (used for short line justification)
- showing of hyperlink along with linked text

Settings take preference in the order - docx2txt.config file in current folder,
docx2txt.config file in same location as docx2txt.pl script, defaults hardcoded
in docx2txt.pl script.

You can also adjust list element indicator characters for different levels, in
docx2txt.pl to suit your formatting taste. Currently 8 level list nesting is
assumed, however if you want to deal with deeper nesting, you can adjust that
as well in the perl script, by following the related comments there.


Note for MC (Midnight Commander) fans
-------------------------------------

You can add following binding in ~/.mc/bindings and view the text content of
.docx file by hitting F3 key (assuming default key mappings) after moving the
cursor over concerned filename in mc pannel.

# Microsoft .docx Document
regex/\.(docx|DOCX|Docx)$
	View=%view{ascii} docx2txt.pl %f -

In case you come across some issue with it, or need a feature that can be
handled in docx to text conversion, please feel free to communicate. An
accompanying test .docx document depicting the issue/need and the corresponding
text file generated by MSOffice with character substitution enabled (or as you
would like the text file to be) will be helpful.
